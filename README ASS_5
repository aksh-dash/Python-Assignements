# 🐍 Python Program: List and Dictionary Operations

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates two key concepts in Python programming:

- **List Slicing and Reversal**
- **Dictionary Key Lookup Based on User Input**

It is designed for beginners to understand basic data structures and user interaction in Python.

---

## 📌 Functionality

### 🔹 1. List Operations

The script performs the following tasks using a list of integers from `1` to `10`:
- **Display the original list**
- **Extract the first five elements** using slicing: `list[0:5]`
- **Reverse** the first five elements using slicing with step `-1`: `[::-1]`

📥 **Example Output:**
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed first five elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

### 🔹 2. Dictionary Operations

The script also demonstrates how to:
- **Define a dictionary** containing student names as keys and marks as values.
- **Prompt the user** to enter a name.
- **Check if the entered name exists** in the dictionary.
- **Print the marks** if found, or display `"Student not found."` if not.

📥 **Example Output:**
Enter a name: Bob
Bob's marks: 30
