# 📘 Assignment 2 - Conditional Statements and Loops

This assignment contains **two Python tasks** focused on the concepts of `if` statements and `for` loops. These are part of basic programming exercises meant to help understand control flow in Python.

---

## 🔹 Assignment 2.1 - If Statement  
### Task: **Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

**Objective:**  
Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether it is even or odd using an `if-else` condition.

**Logic:**  
- If a number is divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`), it is even.
- Else, it is odd.

**Example Output:**
Enter a number: 12
The number is even.

## 🔹 Assignment 2.2 - For Loop  
### Task: **Sum of Integers from 1 to 50**

**Objective:**  
Write a program that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

**Logic:**  
- Initialize `sum = 0`
- Use `for i in range(1, 51)` to iterate from 1 to 50
- Accumulate the sum in the variable

**Example Output:**
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of `if` statements and loops

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code files as:
   - `assignment_2_1.py` (Even/Odd check)
   - `assignment_2_2.py` (Sum using loop)

2. Run each file in terminal or Python IDE:
   ```bash
   python assignment_2_1.py
   python assignment_2_2.py
