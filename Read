📘 Python Math Assignments - Factorial & Math Calculations
This repository contains two basic Python programs that demonstrate:

Recursive function to calculate factorial of a number.

Use of Python's math module to calculate square root, logarithm, and sine of a number.

📂 Contents
🔹 ASSIGNMENT_3.1 - Factorial Using Recursion
This program takes an integer input from the user and calculates its factorial using a recursive function.

Example:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 5  
Factorial of 5 is 120
🔹 ASSIGNMENT_3.2 - Math Calculations using math Module
This program uses the built-in Python math module to calculate the:

Square root

Natural logarithm

Sine value

Example:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 9  
Square root of 9 is 3.0  
Logarithm of 9 is 2.1972245773362196  
Sine of 9 is 0.4121184852417566
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries required (only built-in modules used)

▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-assignments.git
Navigate to the directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd math-assignments
Run the scripts:

bash
Copy
Edit
python assignment_3.1.py
python assignment_3.2.py
📌 Notes
The factorial function uses recursion, which is a common programming technique.

The second script uses math module functions like sqrt(), log(), and sin() which require numeric inputs.

Make sure to enter valid integers when prompted to avoid runtime errors.

📚 Learning Goals
Understand recursive functions in Python.
